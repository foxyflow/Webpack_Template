# Webpack_Template

This is to help anyone get up and running fast using modern JS.

Once downloaded, inside the root folder open a terminal and run:

npm install (to install the necessary node modules)

npm run build (to build the dist folder)

npm run dev (the application will popup in localhost:3000)

 ... (just delete the example code).

 Enjoy.
